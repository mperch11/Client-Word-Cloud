    ##  [9] At the beginning of this year a woman was shot & killed against my vehicle which was impounded as evidence, as a result I was thought to be dead & pronounced shot & killed. Which was very traumatic. Then my father (step-dad) died in February & I was the one to manage everything from his death to the attorneys with POA, last will & trust & still handling his funeral process.My father had asked me to take care of the house, the bills & my mother; now I understand what he meant, they have been hoarders. I’m now focused on cleaning out the house.As a result I’m extremely stressed out and emotionally exhausted. I have no sense of feeling for my own life & feeling an array of emotions at any given moment.

    ## [13] At work, I was hired to work in NICU. It has been 6 years since my hired they started training once and it was stopped. Recently we started again and my boss tried to pull me out again (I am currently continuing). My co workers are hard to work with and I feel like I cannot mess up or show weakness. If and when I do, I lose that little ground I had. I am worried that they will stop my NICU training which is what I’ve wanted to do since high school. I also don’t know how to handle the stress of working in a toxic environment without snapping. I had a hard time coping last time my training stopped. This time I have been having crying episodes and anxiety attacks.

    ## [44] I really want to learn how to be a good partner to my future primary partner. I really wanna learn better relationship habits romantic and social. I’m not very good at socializing. I struggle with anyone that isn’t really “neurotypical” as we discussed. It’s hard. I also struggle paying attention. Texting is easier for me than real life but I love being around people so much, I’m so lonely and alone all the time now… I’m really working on building a support system and social circle. I’m just reevaluating everything in my life, picking it up, looking at it, analyzing it, and thinking about whether or not I want to continue to keep doing that. I wanna learn how to exist in the real world and in the LGBTQIA’s community. I wanna figure out my future steps I want to take towards where I am at physically in a year and figure out a game plan to make it possible. I know this is a lot. I’m a work in progress, always. I’m always working on continuing and moving forward. My mantras are, keep moving forward. Live in the now, not the past. Two way streets. Symbiotic relationships. And just to always be sort of be progressing at least in one area of my life at a time. And working on trying to give self care and just the time to figure things out.

### Removing special characters

``` r
toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
doc <- tm_map(doc, toSpace, "/")
```

    ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(doc, toSpace, "/"): transformation drops

```

### Changing all text to lowercase

``` r

```

    ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(doc, content_transformer(tolower)):

### Removing numbers

### Removing extra whitespace

##Let’s check the document again to confirm our steps

## Perfect. Now we can start to create our matrix for visualization

``` r
matrix <- TermDocumentMatrix(doc)
```

## Turn table in matrix

``` r
m <- as.matrix(matrix)
```

## Sort the matrix

``` r
sorted_matrix <- sort(rowSums(m), decreasing = TRUE)
```

# Now we can turn the matrix into a DataFrame

``` r
matrix_df <- data.frame(word = names(sorted_matrix), freq=sorted_matrix)
```

## Lets check the first 10 values of the DataFrame out

``` r
head(matrix_df, 10)
```

    ##          word freq
    ## work     work    9
    ## just     just    7
    ## feel     feel    6
    ## learn   learn    6
    ## care     care    6
    ## life     life    6
    ## really really    6
    ## want     want    6
    ## time     time    6
    ## lot       lot    5

## Looks like we need to take out some words that don’t matter for our data. We can delete by rows

``` r
matrix_df_v2 <- matrix_df[-c(2, 7, 8, 10), ]
```

## Lets check the top 10 values again

``` r
head(matrix_df_v2, 10)
```

    ##            word freq
    ## work       work    9
    ## feel       feel    6
    ## learn     learn    6
    ## care       care    6
    ## life       life    6
    ## time       time    6
    ## stress   stress    5
    ## working working    5
    ## like       like    5
    ## wanna     wanna    5

## ‘*like*’ and ‘*wanna*’ should be taken out too

``` r
matrix_df_v3 <- matrix_df_v2[-c(9, 10), ]
```

## Check the top again

``` r
head(matrix_df_v3, 10)
```

    ##            word freq
    ## work       work    9
    ## feel       feel    6
    ## learn     learn    6
    ## care       care    6
    ## life       life    6
    ## time       time    6
    ## stress   stress    5
    ## working working    5
    ## better   better    5
    ## years     years    4

## Now we can create our wordcloud

``` r
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = matrix_df_v3$word, freq = matrix_df_v3$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```
